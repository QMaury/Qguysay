# Qguysay
Run the program, then type what the guy will say, and he shall repeat it back to you!
This is pretty much just a spinoff of the classic "Cowsay" program. Mainly just C practice.

(as of February 9th 2022, `guysay` now accepts command-line arguments instead of a shitty `fgets()`. The future is now, old man!)
